# Command-line tools for linguists
## Fall 2019


### Week 1:  Introduction to Command Line Environments

The first week was about getting the command-line environment to work. 
I learned to navigate my computer using the command line by checking my current directory, changing directories, listing the contents of my directory and displaying files in the directory.
I also learned to create new files using a text editor, copy and move files, and create new directories.

### Week 2: Navigating a Unix System

This week, we learned to add, copy and remove entire directories. We learned to compress files and directories and edit permissions. We also learned to connect to a remote server on CSC.

### Week 3: Basic Corpus Processing 

In the third week of the course, we learned to process text corpora using Unix commands. We learned to print only parts of the text (e.g. first or last 50 lines), count the lines and words of a file, transform letters to lower case and sort lines into alphabetical order.
We also learned how to search for text patterns within a file, and cut columns from formatted files (such as tables or spreadsheets).

### Week 4: Advanced Corpus Processing

There were two main topics this week. We learned to combine simple Unix commands to build command pipelines, and we also learned about the sed command to modify text files using regular expressions.

### Week 5: Scripting and Configuration Files

In the fifth week, we were introduced to our bash profiles and what these configuration files mean, and how to modify them. We also learned to write our commands into scripts.   
We were also able to personalize our prompt, which was quite useful.

### Week 6: Installing and Running Programs

Week six was all about installing software and running it. We used brew and pip and learned how to write makefiles and run them. 

### Week 7: Version Control

In the last week of the course, we learned how to use GitHub. We created our own repositories, and learned how to transfer files back and forth between our GitHub and our computer. We learned the commands git clone, add, commit and push. We were introduced to the structure of GitHub repositories and branches.
